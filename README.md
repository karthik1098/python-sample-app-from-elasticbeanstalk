# python-sample-app-from-elasticbeanstalk
In this repo the python sample app was deployed through ElasticBeanstalk from CloudFormation . 
In order to do that we need to create a S3 bucket and upload our source code into that from there a CloudFormation template should be created to create a Elasticbeanstalk application by retrieving the code from s3 
and configuring the required configurations
